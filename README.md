# Parsons Utilities

This is a package that holds parsons modules for use in developing Airbyte connectors. This enables us to include only the parsons features we need to make custom connectors, rather than installing all of the dependencies that are included when you run ```pip install parsons```.

To install this package, simply run:

    pip install git+https://github.com/community-tech-alliance/parsons-utilities
